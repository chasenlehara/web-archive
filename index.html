			 <p>Developers commonly get hung up on setting up the perfect blog before actually blogging. I avoided that temptation by using <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, which makes it really easy to get started and not be fussy with custom code.</p>
<p>That said, I now want to make some improvements to the default theme (<a href="https://sumo.micro.blog">Sumo</a>) that I use on my blogs.</p>
<p>Here’s how I got a fork of the theme running locally with the content from one of my blogs.</p>
<p>First, shout-out to <a href="https://bwlng.com">Stephen Bowling</a> for posting <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/hugo-version-theme-development/1291/9">his approach to running Hugo locally</a>.</p>
<p>I downloaded the <code>hugo_0.117.0_darwin-universal.tar.gz</code> release of Hugo from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.117.0">https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.117.0</a></p>
<p>After moving the <code>hugo</code> binary to <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>, I ran this command to bypass the macOS security gatekeeper:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/hugo
</code></pre><p>Next, I went into my Micro.blog account and clicked on Posts, then in the ··· menu, I clicked Export. From there, I downloaded the “Export theme and Markdown (.zip) — to use in Hugo.” I opened the ZIP file and renamed it <code>web.chasen.dev</code>.</p>
<p>In that folder, I deleted the <code>layouts/</code> folder (so my theme changes could apply).</p>
<p>In that folder, I created a <code>themes/</code> folder. More on that in a moment.</p>
<p>I have Micro.blog archive my content, so I downloaded the <code>uploads</code> folder from <a href="https://github.com/chasenlehara/web-archive">my archive</a> and copied it into the <code>static/</code> folder.</p>
<p>I said at the beginning that I wanted to make changes to the <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Sumo-Theme"><code>Sumo-Theme</code></a>. I forked that repo in GitHub and then cloned it into the <code>themes</code> folder I made a moment ago.</p>
<p>I also cloned <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-blank"><code>theme-blank</code></a> into that folder, so now the <code>themes</code> folder has those two repos inside it. This is required because the “blank” theme provides some partials that are required for building your site.</p>
<p>Now we can get cooking–to run Hugo and have it use the two repos we cloned, I run this command in my <code>web.chasen.dev</code> folder:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo server --themesDir=themes --theme=Sumo-Theme,theme-blank -D
</code></pre><p>Your site should build and be available at http://localhost:1313/</p>
<p>Now, I can make changes to <code>Sumo-Theme</code> and, with the Hugo server running, my site is rebuilt and I can preview the changes locally. Success!</p>

			 <p>Most of <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">AI 2027</a> feels fantastical, but this rings more true every day (July 2027):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped, but there’s never been a better time to be a consultant on integrating AI into your business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the Race timeline (December 2027), fantastical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2027 holiday season is a time of incredible optimism: GDP is ballooning, politics has become friendlier and less partisan, and there are awesome new apps on every phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve lost hope of friendlier and less partisan politics, at least in this administration.</p>
